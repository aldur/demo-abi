JavaScript ABI Demo
-------------------

This directory contains a single code file, `abi.ts`.

In it is a demonstration of the use of the SDK methods used to interact with the Algorand ABI.

If you've taken care of installing the items detailed in the root readme, from this directory you may now
run `npm install`
run `npx ts-node abi.ts`

This should print out some logs about what its doing.  

Currently (12/1/21) the JS SDK does not support foreign types in ABI method calls.
